# 📘 Git Branching Strategy

This document outlines our branching, commit, and merging practices for a cleaner, more maintainable Git history.

based on [GitFlow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

## 🏗 Branch Structure

- `main`  
  - Production-ready, always deployable
- `dev`  
  - Integration branch for tested features before merging to `main`
- `feature/<name>`  
  - Short-lived branches for new features, fixes, or tasks
- `hotfix/<name>`  
  - Urgent patches made directly from `main`

---

## 🔄 Workflow Overview

### ✅ Creating or moving into a feature
```bash
# NEW FEATURE
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b feature/[your-feature]
# MOVING INTO A FEATURE
git branch --list
# Choose your branch
git checkout feature/[your-feature]
git pull origin feature/[your-feature]
```
### After working on code
```bash
git pull origin feature/[your-feature]
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push origin feature/[your-feature]
```


## 📦 Completing a feature
After you are done working on the feature and TESTED:

1.	Rebase onto `dev` again to avoid conflicts.
2.	Merge into dev with squash:

> What is squash? 

> Squash: Combines all the commits from a feature branch into a single commit before merging.

3. Delete local and remote feature branches

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git merge --squash feature/[your-feature]
git commit -m "feat: add chatbot UI and backend logic"
git push origin dev
git branch -d feature/[your-feature]
git push origin --delete feature/[your-feature]
```

## 🚀 Releasing to main
Once tested on dev and ready to go live:
```bash
git checkout main
# Update local main with remote main
git pull origin main
# Merge dev into main
git merge --ff-only dev
# push updated main into remote
git push origin main
```
### Difference between ff-only and rebase
> What is ff-only?
> FF-only : FAST-FORWARD - Merges only if the branch can be moved forward without creating a merge commit.

> Similar to rebase BUT it only works if its directly infront of the source and
> will not rewrite the history
```
# Example: 
A - B - C [main]
         \
          D - E [feature]


A - B - C - D - E [main]
```

> What is rebase then?
```
A - B - C [main]
 \
  D - E [feature]

A - B - C [main]
         \
          D - E [feature]
```

> Similar but rewrites history

## 🛠 Hotfix
```bash
# Start from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create a hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/fix-login
git add . 
git commit -m "fix: correct login redirect URL"

# Merge back into main
git checkout main
git merge -no-ff hotfix/fix-login
git push origin main

# Merge the hotfix with dev as well
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git merge --no-ff hotfix/fix-login
git push origin dev

# Delete hotfix branch
git branch -d
```


## ✅ Commit Message Convention
Use *semantic* prefixes:
- __feat__: for new features
- __fix__: for bug fixes
- __chore__: for cleanup, tooling, etc.
- __refactor__: for code restructuring
- __docs__: for documentation updates

### Example
`feat: add chatbot message rendering`

## 🔒 Rule of thumb
- Avoid merging `main` into feature branches repeatedly. Use `rebase` if needed.
- Always squash merge feature branches into dev.
- Keep branches short-lived -- aim to merge within a few days.
- Prefer pull requests for all merges to `dev` and `main`.

## 📌 Summary
| Task | Command/Rule|
|---|---|
|Create Feature | `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`|
|Sync latest dev | `git fetch && git rebase origin/dev`|
|Merge to dev | `git merge --squash feature/your-feature`|
|Merge dev to main | `git merge --ff-only dev`|
|Delete remote branch | `git push origin --delete feature/branch`|
